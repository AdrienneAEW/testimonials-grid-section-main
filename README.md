## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
- [SCSS](https://sass-lang.com/) - Syntactically Awesome Style Sheets

### What I learned

Mobile first is not a full proof method. With this type of layout it's easier to design for desktop using defaults (which may or may not be responsive across browsers) then to design mobile first. I find you use less code starting out with the desktop.

### Continued development

Will continue working my way through the last lesson before I have to purchase premium. My goal is to revisit all of the challenges and see if I can take it up a notch.
